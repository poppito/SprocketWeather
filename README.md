Welcome to Sprocket Weather! An app that shows you weather information, including temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind radar forecasts.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
This project was built as a part of the #AndroidDevChallenge week 4! I am proud of the fact that even though I had full time work committments, I was able to finish this project.
I know I probably will not win. I am also happy with all the care I have taken to make the app completely accessible in both Light and Dark modes!
